            <h2>What Is The Computer?</h2>
            <p>A computer is a digital electronic machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or
                logical operations (computation) automatically. Modern computers can perform generic sets of operations
                known as programs. These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks. A computer system
                is a "complete" computer that includes the hardware, operating system (main software), and peripheral
                equipment needed and used for "full" operation. This term may also refer to a group of computers that
                are linked and function together, such as a computer network or computer cluster.</p>

            <p>A desktop computer is a computer that fits on or under a desk.</p>
            <p> They utilize peripheral devices for
                interaction, such as a keyboard and mouse for input, and display devices like a monitor, projector, or
                television. Desktop computers can have a horizontal or vertical (tower) form factor, or be combined with
                a monitor to create an All-in-One computer.</p>
            <p> Unlike a laptop, which is portable, desktop computers are
                generally made to stay at one location.</p>

            <p>A laptop, laptop computer, or notebook computer is a small, portable personal computer (PC) with a screen
                and alphanumeric keyboard.</p>
            <p>Laptops typically have a clam shell form factor with the screen mounted on
                the inside of the upper lid and the keyboard on the inside of the lower lid, although 2-in-1 PCs with a
                detachable keyboard are often marketed as laptops or as having a "laptop mode".</p>
            <p>Laptops are folded
                shut for transportation, and thus are suitable for mobile use. They are so named because they can be
                practically placed on a person's lap when being used.</p>
            <p> Today, laptops are used in a variety of settings,
                such as at work, in education, for playing games, web browsing, for personal multimedia, and for general
                home computer use.</p>

            <h2>Tablet</h2>

                alt="tablet">
            <p>A tablet computer, commonly shortened to tablet, is a mobile device, typically with a mobile operating
                system and touchscreen display processing circuitry, and a rechargeable battery in a single, thin and
                flat package.</p>
            <p> Tablets, being computers, do what other personal computers do, but lack some input/output
                (I/O) abilities that others have.</p>
            <p> Modern tablets largely resemble modern smartphones, the only
                differences being that tablets are relatively larger than smartphones, with screens 7 inches (18 cm) or
                larger, measured diagonally and may not support access to a cellular network.</p>
